# dotfiles

A few dotfiles with some configs that I like and don't want to configure manually (hopefully) ever again. Not an extensive list and it is subjective to change as I try to make it better for my needs.

## Usage

The idea here is to be able to run `$ ./setup.sh` for macOS and Ubuntu. It installs the following:

- Homebrew (macOS only)
- iTerm2 (macOS only)
- Git
- Node & Yarn (through Volta.sh)
- Ruby & Rails (through rbenv)
- Neovim (+ .config folder)
- oh-my-zsh (+ .zshrc aliases, plugins and theme)
    - zsh-autosuggestions
    - zsh-syntax-highlighting
    - Powerlevel10k
